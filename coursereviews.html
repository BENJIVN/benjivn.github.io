                <p> enjoyment 4/5</p>
                <p>thoughts: Overall was a good class. The difficulty definitely wasn't anything crazy. Was nice to touch on topics such as Web Scraping, gave me a good refresher on Python and Jupyter Notebook.</p>

                <p>enjoyment: 4/5</p>
                <p>thoughts: class was interesting in itself but overall the structure was alright. just labs every week working through ip addresses and finding small problems. overall it was a better class for understanding the web itself and the workings behind it rather than hands on experience. </p>

                <p>enjoyment: 3.9/5</p>
                <p>thoughts: class definitely was a must at rutgers. taught querying and working with databases. overall very strong class. final project was a full stack application but without a heavy focus on the front end but mainly on querying into a database.</p>

                <p>thoughts: this was definitely one of the harder classes for me. the harder concepts of oop were taught and it kind of messed with me hard because oop is already kind of difficult for me. overall good class and was well needed in learning oop!</p>

                <p>thoughts: the class was really fun and we read some pretty great readings. towards the end we worked with texts that focused heavily on machines and AI. overall the class was a good philosophy class, would definitely take if you are into learning about the ethics behind AI in today's industry.</p>

                <p>enjoyment: 3/5</p>
                <p>thoughts: class was definitely very different then most classes at rutgers but the concepts are really necessary. C is an awesome language and will continue it in CS214. Overall class was pretty decent, concepts were rushed but I also suck at assembly.</p>

                <p>enjoyment: 4/5</p>
                <p>thoughts: the class was definitely a big punch in the face when I first started. i wasn't super comfortable with specific data structures and then also manipulating them as much as I had too for the class. the class went over a lot of topics and different types of algorithms and searches. overall, great class and it helped a lot with easy + medium leet code questions!</p>

                <p>thoughts: the professor, professor blackmore, was extremely nice and the problem sets he gave out were kind of fun. lots of probability and multiple steps! overall the class was very different from discrete structures 1 but it was a good introduction class towards CS344.</p>

                <p>thoughts: the class was actually not bad and pretty cool. the first class I took that was completely foreign to me and the concepts taught, i can see how now everything I do is based on DS1 here. you don't see it while you're coding but everything you do it step by step just like the basic you learn here!</p>

                <p>thoughts: the assignments were definitely creative. the last assignment's concept was thanos and undirected graphs. class was definitely an important class, after the class, most easy's on leetcode are possible. the class definitely helped a lot for foundation but it was really just a basic data structure class with little emphasis on the coding aspect but rather the material.</p>

                <p>thoughts: overall the class was a fine introduction course. this was my first cs class at took since tranferring from being a nursing/finance student at my old school (yikes). but it was an okay class. the class was definitely carried by the professor, she was awesome!</p>
