            <div class="descr">Unfortunately I was not able to find an internship this summer. Bummer! I definitely was not a strong canidate. My first year I was too focused on graduating on time and catching up but I regret not taking my time in the major and really finding my passion for it. During this summer I started working on algorithms but also building small little projects to find enjoyment in computer science. I built small applications like anyone would, to-do list, weather app, and an attempt at a full fitness app, p.s. i failed horribly. However, it really helped me develop skills for work flow and getting pretty good at Git commands.</div>
